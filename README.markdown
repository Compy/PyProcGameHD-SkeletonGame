This codebase exists for folks looking to code their own rules for pinball machines powered by either the P-ROC or P3-ROC, available from [pinballcontrollers.com](http://pinballcontrollers.com).  This framework is a fork of [PyProcGame](http://www.github.com/preble/pyprocgame), a Python based pinball programming framework.  Rather than traditional DMD hardware, it supports traditional PC display hardware (i.e., LCD) for high-resolution, full-color display via SDL2/OpenGL based hardware acceleration (PyProcGameHD) and tries to reduce the amount of code you have to write to create a new game with 'typical components' (via SkeletonGame).

The code, documentation, and this page itself are a work in progress.  Please bear with me.  Please report bugs, issues, problems, etc.  Either use the GitHub issue tracker, or go to the thread on the PinballControllers forum, [here](http://www.pinballcontrollers.com/forum/index.php?topic=1500.0).  

Thank you.
